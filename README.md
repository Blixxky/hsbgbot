# Installation

This project requires Python 3.11 (like MFB-Realive)
[Download Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)

1. Download the repo.
2. Set Hearthstone to windowed 1024x768 and open it up to the Battlegrounds "Play" screen.
3. Run launch.bat (be patient as it has to initialize and install dependencies).

To stop the bot, simply close the terminal window, or put it in focus and CTRL+C to terminate.

# Warning

Blizzard is known to ban people for botting Battlegrounds. Use this sparingly and don't go on marathons.
